                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>The client lacked a clear, organized process for managing their real estate transactions. With a high volume of incoming leads, they struggled to manually categorize and prioritize 'hot,' 'warm,' and 'cold' leads effectively. This also made it challenging to consistently nurture leads that weren't immediately ready, as well as past clients.</p>

                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>My solution focused on implementing a streamlined, automated process. I defined clear transaction stages and built AI-powered automations to analyze client communications, automatically placing leads into the correct pipeline stage. This included dynamic, stage-specific follow-up workflows and dedicated nurturing campaigns for past clients.</p>

                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p> Leads were accurately placed into the pipeline, making it easier to identify the most promising opportunities. The automated follow-ups ensured no lead fell through the cracks, and past clients felt valued.</p>
